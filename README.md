# Frontend_test_Stopwatch
Create one container in which all the elements are present.
Inside this container add 2 divs that contain all time elements like an hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and another div contains 3 buttons for start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
Now add Styles to center the div container.
Next, add a JavaScript file in which we will add onclick functions on all three buttons and create another function in which write all the logical code and add value to corresponding hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, etc.
